In this Scene the main idea was to create a nice outdoor landscape with mountains, a forest, a lake, and a cabin, inspired by a family home out in Pennsylvania.
All the assets I made were done in blender which consist of:
	The lake with a shader applied to it (1 asset)
	The tree which I painted over the terrain (1 asset)
	And the Terrain itself which I scupled mountains out of (1 big asset)
I imported the rest of the assets from unity asset store, which consist of:
	5 different rock types (5 assets)
	2 Sports cars (2 assets)
	The fox, bear, and bird animals (3 assets)
	The cottages and fences (3 assets)
	The player in front of one of the houses, which is where the first and third person are positioned (1 asset)
(17 unique asset, 3 of which are created by me, one is the designated player)
