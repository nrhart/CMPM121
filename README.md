## Homework 1

In this Scene the main idea was to create a nice outdoor landscape with mountains, a forest, a lake, and a cabin, inspired by a family home out in Pennsylvania.
All the assets I made were done in blender which consist of:
	-The lake with a shader applied to it (1 asset)
	-The tree which I painted over the terrain (1 asset)
	-And the Terrain itself which I scupled mountains out of (1 big asset)
I imported the rest of the assets from unity asset store, which consist of:
	-5 different rock types (5 assets)
	-2 Sports cars (2 assets)
	-The fox, bear, and bird animals (3 assets)
	-The cottages and fences (3 assets)
	-The player in front of one of the houses, which is where the first and third person are positioned (1 asset)
(17 unique asset, 3 of which are created by me, one is the designated player)

## Homework 2

For this assignment I added all 5 light effect to my scene
	-The spotlights was put infront of the player acting like a flash light
	-The area light was put over the main focus of the scene to better give an idea of where the focus should be
	-The directional cam is the sun which allows me to do a day night cycle with a display timer
	-The pond in the scene is give a Emissive Material to allow it glow bright throughout the night
I opted to do a day night Cycle that displays the time of day it is in the top right corner
For the particle system I added a 2D Texture emitter and put a Chimney on one of the house and made it look like smoke.
