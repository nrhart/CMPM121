## Homework 1

<p>In this Scene the main idea was to create a nice outdoor landscape with mountains, a forest, a lake, and a cabin, inspired by a family home out in Pennsylvania.<br>
All the assets I made were done in blender which consist of:<br>
	-The lake with a shader applied to it (1 asset)<br>
	-The tree which I painted over the terrain (1 asset)<br>
	-And the Terrain itself which I scupled mountains out of (1 big asset)<br>

(17 unique asset, 3 of which are created by me, one is the designated player)</P>

## Homework 2

<p>For this assignment I added all 5 light effect to my scene<br>
	-The spotlights was put infront of the player acting like a flash light<br>
	-The area light was put over the main focus of the scene to better give an idea of where the focus should be<br>
	-The directional cam is the sun which allows me to do a day night cycle with a display timer<br>
	-The pond in the scene is give a Emissive Material to allow it glow bright throughout the night<br>
I opted to do a day night Cycle that displays the time of day it is in the top right corner<br>
For the particle system I added a 2D Texture emitter and put a Chimney on one of the house and made it look like smoke.</p>
